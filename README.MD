# Jikan REST API Source

This REST API is built on Lumen and is in development, therefore neither will I produce or help in any form for any kind of in-depth installation/set up or guides for the time being


## What this requires
- Composer
- Lumen
- BugSnag (API Key)
- JikanPHP Library (just composer update)
- Redis

## Quick set up
1. Git Clone the repo
2. Rename `.env.example` to `.env`
3. `composer update`
4. Make a BugSnag Account & set the API Key in `.env`
5. Install Redis
