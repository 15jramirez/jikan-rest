Jikan is a REST API for [MyAnimeList.net](https://myanimelist.net). It scrapes the website to satisfy the need for an API - which MyAnimeList lacks.

The raison d'√™tre of Jikan is to assist developers easily get the data they need for their apps and projects without having to depend on the lackluster official API, unstable APIs, or sidetracking their projects to develop parsers.

The word _Jikan_ literally translates to _Time_ in Japanese (**ÊôÇÈñì**). And that's what this API saves you of. ;)


**Notice**: Jikan does not support authenticated requests. You can not update your lists.

## Getting Started

### Requirements

- PHP 7.1+
- [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/download/)
- [Redis](https://redis.io)

### Installation


#### üê≥ Docker
- [JikanREST Docker](https://github.com/fethica/jikan-rest-docker) by Fethi El Hassasna

#### Linux

This is specifically for Ubuntu, but other distributions should work similarly.

1. Install requirements:
  - Add PHP related packages: `sudo add-apt-repository -y ppa:ondrej/php`
    - If `add-apt-repository` is not installed, you can install it by doing `sudo apt install python-software-properties` or `sudo apt install software-properties-common`
  - `sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade`
  - Install requirements: `sudo apt install curl git php redis-server unzip supervisor`
  - Verify that PHP 7.1+ is installed: `php -v`
  - Install the corresponding `php-xml` and `php-mbstring` packages for your version, e.g:
    - PHP 7.1: `sudo apt install php7.1-xml php7.1-mbstring`
    - PHP 7.3: `sudo apt install php7.3-xml php7.3-mbstring`
  - Install composer: `curl -sS https://getcomposer.org/installer | sudo php -- --install-dir=/usr/local/bin --filename=composer`
2. Start the redis server: `sudo service redis start`
3. Configure Supervisor
    1. `sudo cp conf/supervisor/jikan-worker.conf /etc/supervisor/conf.d`
    2. `sudo supervisorctl reread`
    3. `sudo supervisorctl update`
    4. `sudo supervisorctl start jikan-worker:*`

#### Mac

1. Install [brew](https://brew.sh/)
2. Install requirements: `brew install php composer redis`
3. Start the redis server: `brew services start redis`

### Run

1. `git clone https://github.com/jikan-me/jikan-rest.git`
2. `cd jikan-rest`
3.  Rename `.env.dist` to `.env`: `mv .env.dist .env`
4. `composer update`
5. `composer install`

To start the server, create a virtual host and point it to `/public`:

`php -S localhost:8000 -t public`

Jikan is now hosted on `http://localhost:8000/v3/`

### Information
If you don't want to host your instance, there's a public API available.
