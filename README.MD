# Jikan REST API Source

This REST API is built on Lumen and is in development, therefore neither will I produce or help in any form for any kind of in-depth installation/set up or guides for the time being


## What this requires
- Composer
- Lumen
- BugSnag
- JikanPHP Library (just composer update)
- Redis

## Quick set up
1. Install Lumen
2. Overwrite with this
3. `composer update`
4. Make a BugSnag Account & set the details in `.env`
5. Set up Redis & enter the connection credentials in `.env`
